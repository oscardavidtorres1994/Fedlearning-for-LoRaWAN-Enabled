# README: Anomaly Detection Methods for IIoT for LoRaWAN Enabled. 

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of four different anomaly detection methods for Industrial IoT (IIoT) for LoRaWAN Enabled environments. Each method is organized in its own folder, containing a Jupyter Notebook and a README file with specific details.  Base repository of the work “Federated Learning framework for LoRaWAN-enabled IIoT communication: A case study”

## Structure

Autoencoder Centralized/ - Implements a centralized autoencoder-based anomaly detection method.
Autoencoder Federated Learning/ - Implements a descentralized autoencoder-based anomaly detection method.
IsolationForest/ - Implements Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.
OneClassSVM/ - Implements One-Class SVM for anomaly detection.
Data Sample/ - Contains the datasets used for training, validation, and testing.


## Datasets
Within the folder "/Data Sample" there are 4 datasets: 

- Complete.csv
- Train.csv
- Validation.csv
- Test.csv

## How to Use
Each folder contains its own README file with detailed instructions on how to install dependencies, run the Jupyter Notebook, and interpret the results.
